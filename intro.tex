\chapter{Introduction for the Second Version}

This document is the answer to my need to have all my aircraft equations and UAV-related models in one place, with reliable literature to support them. I has already been useful to me as a reference and as a quick source of models for my colleagues, and I hope you will find it equally useful.

The second version of this document signals two significant changes.

First of all, I have decided to include C-style code snippets for all derivations. When using models containing vector operations or dynamic equations, their implementation often presents difficulties and a lot of head-scratching. Converting the multiplication of a rotation matrix with a vector, for use in an embedded computer is a sore example; one simple equation can take forever to write. By having the code-snippets readily available I hope to help anyone who undertakes a simulation project from the beginning have a head-start (including me).

Also, the document will no longer be placed under the umbrella of the Basic Air Data project (\url{www.basicairdata.eu}), since I, myself, am no longer part of it. I now develop it during my work as a PhD candidate and the university logo sits at the front page.
