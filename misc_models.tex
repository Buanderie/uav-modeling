\chapter{Miscellaneous Models}

During simulation, other models are required to complement the aircraft mathematical description. These describe the rest of the environment and its evolution and are necessarily included, if the interactions of the aircraft with its environment are to be modeled. The shape of the Earth, its gravity and magnetic field, the atmosphere as well as the wind are topics discussed in this chapter.
